This is a simple project created with the purpose of learning about CSS 3D capabilities, using HTML divs to drawn each face of the 3D objects. I choose to recreate a Minecraft scene since the square design fits very well with HTML limitations. Drawing complex 3D scenes with CSS is far from ideal, it's very awkward to control the drawing order of the faces and the rendering capabilities in general are very (very) far away from something like WebGL, I wouldn't recommend it at all, it's a good challenge though. React component system helped a lot in the process, it was super fast to make a component and copy-paste it through the scene.
